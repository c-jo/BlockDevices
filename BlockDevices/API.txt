Device names

Device names are a `/` separated list of components which make up
the device, in a simple tree structure. The device paths always
start with a `/` character once registered. Identifiers within the
device path are usually lower case, but are not case sensitive.
They should, generally, be given as simple ASCII strings. Indexes
given within the device name should be 0-indexed unless an existing
naming scheme requires a different form. A separator character
should be used for each logical component of the path.

For example, a device path might take the form:

/scsi/1/2/3     - The SCSI device on bus 1, device 2, LUN 3.
/nvme/0/1       - The second disk attached to the first NVMe
                  device.
/nvme/0/1/gpt/0 - The first partition on the above device,
                  using the GUID Partition Type format.


SWI API

SWI BlockDevices_Enumerate
=>  R0 = last device id, or 0 to start enumeration
<=  R0 = 0 if no more devices
         or device id of this device
    R1 = device information block

Enumerates the currently registered devices.


SWI BlockDevices_Read
=>  R0 = device id to read to
    R1 = flags for the read operation (?)
    R2 = transfer block:
            +0  64bit LBA to read
            +4  pointer to memory to read into
            +8  number of bytes to read


Reads data from the block device.
On return from the read operation, the transfer block should return the block updated
with a new LBA, pointer to memory and number of bytes, even if the transfer failed.

FIXME: Is R2 actually a list of blocks? How is it terminated?
What are the flags?

Errors:
    BadDevice: returned when the device id supplied is not valid.


SWI BlockDevices_Write
=>  R0 = device id to write to
    R1 = flags for the write operation (?)
    R2 = transfer block:
            <as for BlockDevices_Read>

Writes data to the block device.


SWI BlockDevices_Register

=>  R0 = flags (must be 0)
    R1 = pointer to the device information block
    R2 = pointer to entry point
    R3 = entry point R12
<=  R0 = device id for registered device

Register a block device driver.

On registration the device name may be given one of 4 ways:

* 0 or an empty string, to use a simple incrementing value.
  This should only be used for prototype devices.
* A fully specified path, starting with a `/` character.
* A device name, with parent device supplied. In this form,
  the device name will be appended to the path of the parent
  device.
* A device name, without a parent device supplied. In this
  form, the device name will have a `/` character prepended.

Errors:
    RegisterFailed: Reported when the device is not recognised.


SWI BlockDevices_Deregister

=>  R0 = device id to deregister

Deregister a block device driver.


Entrypoint:

=>  R0 = Operation code:
            1 => Read data
            2 => Write data
    R1..R9 = parameters dependant on the entry point
